# happyShapy
a simple shape drawing app made in 8 hours in SwiftUI

demo at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BKiEiTkb7LmWwdL8JAZZEFkZriMDPJJR/view?usp=sharing

features:
 - runs on iPhone, iPad and MacOS
 - adding of multiple shapes (easily extensible)
 - supports translation, scale and rotation 
 - toggle shape visibility
 - left panel is shrinkable to make more space on the scren
 - supports both light and dark mode
 - ready for localization
 
 
 what could be improved:
 - handling negative values while doing transformations
 - rotation (i have selected quite clumsy coordinate system)
 - there are several hardcoded constants (like left panel width) which makes it unusable on portrait mode on iphone
